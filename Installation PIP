First, install pip
If you don’t have pip, you’ll need to obtain it first:

pip install opencv
$ wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
$ sudo python3 get-pip.py
Option A: Install OpenCV to your Ubuntu system with pip
I wouldn’t recommend this method unless you have a particular use case where you don’t want isolated, independent Python environments.

Let’s pip install opencv-contrib-python on our system:

pip install opencv
$ sudo pip install opencv-contrib-python
